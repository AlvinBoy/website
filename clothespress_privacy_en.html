    <p>The AiClothes app is a wardrobe product, and we highly respect your personal information and data. We strive to protect the security and reliability of your personal information and data. This privacy policy is developed and published in accordance with the relevant policies of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.</p>

        <h2>1. Collection of Information: Methods and Scope</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">1.1 Access to Album or Camera</span>: You can upload the items and outfits you need by accessing your album or use the camera for real-time photography. You can delete them later through the management section when they are no longer needed.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">1.2 Accessing Device Information</span>: To uniquely identify a device, we will obtain the hardware information of your device (including but not limited to OAID, IMEI, IMSI, MAC address, device serial number, BSSID, SSID) once you agree to the privacy policy. Third-party SDKs may also access device information during initialization. This data is used to track app usage and prevent repeated SMS verification code requests from the same phone within a short period.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">1.3 Use of Third-Party SDKs</span>: In order to provide professional and reliable services, these SDKs are initialized and run only after you agree to the privacy policy. Below are the third-party SDKs used in the app:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Umeng Analytics SDK</strong>: Used for app operation statistics and analysis. This SDK will access the device's hardware information (including but not limited to OAID, IMEI, IMSI, MAC address, device serial number, AndroidID, BSSID, SSID).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><span class="highlight">1.4 Complaints and Reporting</span>: You can click on "Feedback" under "My" in the app to file complaints or report any personal information or other issues you encounter.</li>
